The surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane was uneventful, lasting 98 min, during which the patient maintained oxygen saturation readings of 100% on 8 l of oxygen. She has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis of her right knee. Her medications include ramipril, naproxen, ranitidine, and a multivitamin. She appears cyanotic, drowsy, and is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 38.6 °C (101.5 °F), pulse is 135/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dl, a leukocyte count of 9000/mm3, a platelet count of 145,000/mm3, and a creatine kinase of 190 U/l. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

Petechiae can form in response to capillary inflammation caused by fat emboli. Fat micro globules cause CNS microcirculation occlusion causing confusion and altered mental status. Fat obstruction in the pulmonary arteries can cause tachycardia and shortness of breath as seen in this patient. This patient most likely has a fat embolism.”\n",
